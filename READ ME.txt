To run the prototype, double click on index.html which will open the game in our browser. Use WASD to move
the black square (the player). The brown squares are the coins to collect. Once a coin is collected, another
spawns randomly in the grid. At the top-right, there is the score counter and the timer which counts down
from 30 seconds. Once the timer ends, the screen will display 'Victory!', press any key to restart the game.
